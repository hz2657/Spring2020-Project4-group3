**Project summary:** 

In this project, we explored matrix factorization methods for recommender system. The goal is to recommend consumers with most appropriate products. Matrix factorization methods characterize both items and users by vectors of factors inferred from item rating patterns. High correspondence between item and user factors leads to a recommendation. Matrix factorization generally has 3 parts: 1. factorization algorithm  2. regularization  3. postpocessing. 

Given data sets including 610 users and 9724 movies, we implemented ALS withour regularizations and ALS with regularizations(R1 and R2).After fitting the model, we used Kernel Ridge Regreesion for postprocessing. Our result shows that the more latent factors we use, the lower the final RMSE is.
